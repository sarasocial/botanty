## about botanty üå±
botanty ~~is~~ (hopefully, if i can figure it out, will be) a framework for building digital gardens with eleventy, with the aim of providing a simple set of tools to help you dynamically manage the creation and placement of hyperlinks on across pages on build, both individually and en masse

the name is a play on botany and eleventy. get it?

because botany is the branch of biology that focuses on the scientific study of plants, investigating their roles in ecosystems, their interactions with other organisms, and their uses by humans. and eleventy is a simple, fast, and flexible static site generator designed to help developers build static websites with ease and minimalism.  

and since   gardens are spaces wher ethe rules of botany are applied.

so you make a digital garden in eleventy. and tend to it with botany. or botanty. get it ?do you get it
